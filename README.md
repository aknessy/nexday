Repo for the Nexday Web Application Project.

What is Nexday? Nexday is a web application built for listing of vacant, available apartments and landed property. It is designed with the view to aid housing/property seekers easily locate vacant accomodation from the comfort of where ever they are. It integrates a feature called `autodots`.
Autodots are group of persons that serve as inspectors. They help would-be tenants, and other customers inspect apartments, items, etc before they are purchased or paid for. Autodots are automatically created when a user shares his/her location in longitude and latitude. This group of persons can earn an additional income based on an agreement.
